Minima CAD
==========

Credit goes to Adrian over at http://yo4hhp.wordpress.com/ who did the original Eagle work and Ashhar Farhan over at http://www.phonestack.com/farhan/minima.html for the original Minima design.
There is a mailing list at http://www.freelists.org/archive/minima/recent for the Minima radio.

What I've done is combine the two radio boards in to a single eagle brd/sch file and wrote up a BOM for DigiKey.
What I'd like to do is be able to run boards off at OSHPark, buy a bag of parts of DigiKey and have a radio.

What still needs done:

- [ ] Hole Drill Sizes. Adrian designed this for ease of home manufacture not for OSHPark so it will take some tweaks.
- [ ] Cleanup silkscreen. It's pretty clean already there's just a bit of overlap here and there.
- [ ] Cleanup part values for consistency
- [ ] Cleanup BOM. There are a few resistor/capacitor lines that could be combined.
- [ ] Verify BOM. I went through and generally picked the cheapest parts available. Many of these have fairly loose tolerances which might not work in a radio (I don't know).
==========

Quick Notes:
- These boards aren't ready yet for OSHPark so don't spend the money on it just yet.
- The BOM is reasonably complete but it is missing tuning inductors and a knob. Money could easily be saved by not buying SMA connectors and using a bit of coax. The LCD could also be bought elsewhere to save money.
